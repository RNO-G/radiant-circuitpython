# RADIANT CircuitPython core

This Python code is for running ** on ** the Board Manager in CircuitPython
mode. At some point portions of this + the full radiant-python core need
to be merged, because in a lot of ways they're dead copies of each other.

But because this is the CircuitPython core, there's not a ton of comments
and a fair amount of magic numbers. See the radiant-python code for
more details.
